# Features

The **Trade Journal** application is designed to serve as a comprehensive virtual trading assistant, empowering traders by providing real-time insights, recommendations, and validations tailored to their specific strategies. Below are the detailed features of the application, including their functionalities, edge cases, and specific business rules or validation requirements.

## 1. Strategy Management

### Description

Users can create and manage multiple trading strategies, each serving as the foundation for journaling trades, backtesting, and generating insights. This centralized approach ensures that all related activities are organized and aligned with specific trading methodologies.

### Functionalities

- **Create/Edit/Delete Strategies:** Users can create new strategies, modify existing ones, or delete strategies they no longer employ.
- **Configurable Strategy Settings:** Each strategy can have custom settings and parameters (e.g., risk-reward ratio, trade duration) that define its unique characteristics.
- **Validation:**
  - Strategy names must be unique per user.
  - All required strategy parameters must be defined before saving.

### Edge Cases

- **Duplicate Strategy Names:** Prevent creation of strategies with names that already exist for the user.
- **Incomplete Strategy Configurations:** Ensure that strategies have all necessary configurations before allowing trade logging or backtesting.

## 2. AI-Assisted Trade Logging

### Description

Enable users to log their trade setups with detailed information while receiving real-time AI-driven recommendations, warnings, and tips. This feature acts as a personal trading advisor, helping users make informed decisions before executing trades.

### Functionalities

- **Log Trade Setup:** Users can input trade setup details such as pair, setup conditions, strategy association, and other configurable fields.
- **AI Recommendations Popup:** Before logging the trade, a popup presents AI-generated insights, including recommendations, warnings, and tips based on the user's strategy and historical data.
- **Decision Making:** Users can review the AI insights and decide whether to proceed with logging the trade or revise their setup accordingly.
- **Trade Validation:** Ensures that all mandatory fields are completed and that the trade setup adheres to the defined strategy parameters before logging.
- **Status Tracking:** Once a trade is logged, its status can be updated (e.g., Order Placed, Open, Closed) to monitor its lifecycle.

### Validation

- **Mandatory Fields:** Ensure all required fields (e.g., pair, setup conditions, strategy) are completed before allowing trade logging.
- **Logical Consistency:** Validate that setup conditions make logical sense (e.g., dates are in proper order, risk-reward ratios are within acceptable ranges).
- **AI Insight Accuracy:** Verify that AI-generated insights are relevant and based on accurate historical data.

### Edge Cases

- **Incomplete Trade Setups:** Prevent logging of trades with missing required information.
- **Conflicting AI Insights:** Handle scenarios where AI recommendations conflict with user inputs by allowing users to override or adjust based on their judgment.
- **Insufficient Data for Insights:** Ensure that meaningful AI insights are only generated when sufficient historical data is available; otherwise, prompt the user to backtest or log more trades.

## 3. Backtest Logging

### Description

Allow users to record and analyze backtested trades, providing a foundation for strategy optimization and AI-driven insights. Backtesting helps in evaluating the effectiveness of strategies under different market conditions without real financial risk.

### Functionalities

- **Edit/Delete Backtested Trades:** Ability to modify or remove incorrectly logged backtested trades.
- **AI Insights Integration:** Incorporate AI-driven insights similar to live trade logging to evaluate backtested trades.
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor the performance of backtested trades to assess strategy effectiveness.

### Validation

- **Mandatory Fields:** Ensure all required fields are completed before allowing backtest trade logging.
- **Logical Consistency:** Validate the accuracy of backtest trade details (e.g., dates, results).

### Edge Cases

- **Duplicate Backtest Entries:** Prevent logging of identical backtest trades to maintain data integrity.
- **Inconsistent Backtest Data:** Handle scenarios where backtest data may not align with strategy parameters, prompting users to adjust their inputs.

## 4. Performance Analytics

### Description

Provide users with comprehensive analytics and visual representations of their trading performance across different strategies. This feature helps in identifying patterns, strengths, and areas for improvement.

- **Real-Time Updates:** Performance analytics should reflect the latest trade data without delays.

### Edge Cases
