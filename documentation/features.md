The trade journal app is your personal ai-powered trading assistant, built to help traders configure strategies, log trades, and gain actionable insights.

1. Strategy management
   - create, edit, and manage strategies that serve as the foundation for journaling and backtesting.
   - configure strategies using dropdowns, text inputs, and options for multi-timeframe setups (e.g., weekly criteria, daily patterns, 4h entries).
   - ensures all strategy configurations are complete before allowing trade logging or backtesting.
2. Trade journaling
   - log trades based on configured strategies with all key setup details.
   - receive ai insights before confirming a trade, offering suggestions, warnings, and advice based on historical data (e.g., "check weekly criteriaâ€”similar setups failed without it").
   - track trade status through its lifecycle: open, win, loss, or break-even.
3. Backtesting
   - log backtest trades with the same flow as live journaling to evaluate strategies in various market conditions.
   - can be split up into different backtest "sessions" to test out approaches or ideas for that strategy.
   - provides ai-driven feedback for backtested setups to refine strategy effectiveness.
   - the more trades logged, the smarter and more relevant the ai insights become.
4. performance analytics
   - visualize performance metrics like win rate, avg pnl, and drawdown for each strategy.
   - compare performance across strategies and identify patterns with charts and graphs.
5. ai insights integration
   - real-time recommendations tailored to your strategy and trade history.
   - highlights patterns, flags risks, and forecasts potential trade outcomes based on historical data.
   - learns and improves through user feedback to deliver increasingly accurate and relevant insights.
