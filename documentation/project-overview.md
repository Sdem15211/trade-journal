## project overview

this app is designed as a comprehensive journaling and analytics tool for traders, empowering them to track and optimize their trading performance. the core idea is to provide a highly customizable platform tailored to each trader’s unique strategy, allowing them to seamlessly log trades, analyze results, and gain valuable insights into their trading habits.

### features

1. **trade logging**

   - users can log their trades with relevant details such as trading pair, entry/exit dates, p&l, and notes. the interface is clean and intuitive, ensuring quick and efficient data entry.

2. **customizable criteria**

   - the app supports full customization to fit any trading strategy. traders can define their own criteria and parameters, ensuring the tool adapts to their individual trading style and approach.

3. **data-driven insights**

   - the app becomes more powerful as users log more data. whether it's live trades or backtesting historical data, all entries contribute to generating actionable ai-driven insights. these insights help traders identify patterns, improve their decision-making, and refine their strategies.

4. **backtesting support**

   - backtesting is treated the same as live journaling, enabling users to log and analyze historical trades with the same level of detail. this ensures consistent data collection and allows for a unified analysis across both live and past market conditions.

5. **ai insights**
   - leveraging the logged data, the app provides advanced ai insights, helping traders uncover hidden trends, potential weaknesses, and opportunities for growth. these insights are personalized, based on the trader's specific strategy and performance history.

### philosophy

this app is not a one-size-fits-all solution—it’s a personal trading assistant. its strength lies in adaptability and customization, making it a valuable tool for traders of all styles. by centralizing and analyzing trading data, the app supports continuous improvement and helps users make smarter, more informed decisions in their trading journey.
